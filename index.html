    <h1>Welcome to the NMSU Biomechanics Lab</h1>
    <p>The NMSU biomechanics laboratory focuses on understanding and improving movement for clinical populations through advanced biomechanical analysis. Our mission is to understand and enhance mobility by investigating lower extremity and trunk biomechanics during gait, exploring dual-task paradigms, and examining the motor and cognitive performance relationship. We integrate clinical biomechanics, human movement science, and experimental gait analysis to develop evidence-based strategies that support personalized interventions for clinical populations. A central focus of our work is studying movement in children with autism to inform targeted interventions that improve participation and functional mobility.</p>
