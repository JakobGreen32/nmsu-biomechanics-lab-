    <h2>Gait in Children with Autism</h2>
    <p>We investigate gait and movement strategies in children with autism to better understand how lower extremity and trunk biomechanics impact mobility. Our work identifies unique motor patterns and adaptations during walking, informing interventions that improve participation and functional independence.</p>
    <h2>Cognitive and Mobility Relationships</h2>
    <p>We examine how cognition influences gait and postural control, aiming to clarify cognitive-motor links that affect safety and mobility in children with autism.</p>
    <h2>Dual-Task Paradigms</h2>
    <p>We study the effects of performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously on gait and stability in children with autism, guiding personalized strategies to enhance mobility.</p>
